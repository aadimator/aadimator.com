After completing this Specialization, you’ll be able to develop your own Java programs using a principled problem-focused approach. You’ll be prepared to solve rigorous computational problems in new contexts, and to pursue further study in computer science and software development.

This Specialization will teach you core programming concepts and equip you to write programs to solve complex problems. In addition, you will gain the foundational skills a software engineer needs to solve real-world problems, from designing algorithms to testing and debugging your programs.
