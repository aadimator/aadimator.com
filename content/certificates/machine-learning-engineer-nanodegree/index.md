I learned the basic, as well as more advanced concepts of Machine Learning, from Supervised learning to Unsupervised Learning and reinforcement learning. I learned how to apply predictive models to massive data sets in fields like finance, healthcare, education, and more. I completed several projects along the way to further solidify the concepts.
