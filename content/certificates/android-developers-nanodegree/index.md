I learned advanced Android development in this Nanodegree. I learned about the best practices that are being used in the industry to create good looking, effective and efficient Android applications. I learned how to use Material Design in an Android app effectively, how to create Widgets, how to work with background services, how to use external API and services in the application and many more.
