In five courses, I learned the foundations of Deep Learning, understood how to build neural networks, and learned how to lead successful machine learning projects. I also learned about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. I worked on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. I mastered not only the theory, but also saw how it is applied in industry. I practiced all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow.
