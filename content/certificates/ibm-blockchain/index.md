I learned high-level concepts, components, and strategies on building blockchain business networks. I got hands-on experience modeling and building blockchain networks as well as created my first blockchain application. After completing the course, I understand what a blockchain business network is, how to build and model a simple blockchain solution, and the role of the developer in creating blockchain applications.
