title: Machine Learning with TesorFlow on Google Cloud Platform Specialization
subtitle: Hands-on Machine Learning Specialization with free GCP access for practice.
description: Learned how to write distributed machine learning models that scale in
  TensorFlow, scale-out the training of those models, and offer high-performance predictions.
  Learned how to convert raw data to features in a way that allows ML to learn important
  characteristics from the data and bring human insight to bear on the problem. Finally,
  learned how to incorporate the right mix of parameters that yields accurate, generalized
  models and knowledge of the theory to solve specific types of ML problems. Experimented
  with end-to-end ML, starting from building an ML-focused strategy and progressing
  into model training, optimization, and productionalization with hands-on labs using
  Google Cloud Platform.
