title: Now

_This is my now page, on which I share what I’m up to besides my project work as an independent developer. If you have your own site,_ [_you should make a now page_](https://nownownow.com/about)_, too._

## Writing

This past week I've been busy working on redesigning this website. Now, I'm planning to write more articles. The one that I'm working on right now is related to Genetic algorithms and how they are used for Multiple Sequence Alignment in Bioinformatics.

## Reading

I am still quite behind on my yearly reading challenge (of 50 books). Currently, I’m reading:

* [Digital minimalism](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy/dp/0525536515 "Digital Minimalism"), by Cal Newport
* [What is Real?](https://www.amazon.com/What-Real-Unfinished-Meaning-Quantum/dp/0465096050 "What is Real?") by John McPhee

## Learning

I have started a Bioinformatics specialization on Coursera and I'm quite excited to learn more about this field, among other things. Also, I still want to take a deeper look into [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), because I heard a lot of praise for this JS framework.
