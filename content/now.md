\_as-salāmu ʿalaykum (\_peace be upon you). I'm Aadam and welcome to my blog. I'm a machine learning engineer, motion designer, illustrator, and an all-around nerd. I'm super excited to share what I'm learning here on this blog. I'm also available for **freelance** work as well. Feel free to contact me.
