* Reviewed unstructured data to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. 
* Used multiple algorithms and both empirically and theoretically compared and contrasted their results. 
* Made predictions about the natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then checked these predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis.
