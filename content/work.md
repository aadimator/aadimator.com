  - title: Considered development
    description: <p>No two projects are the same and I take a pragmatic approach to each job I take on, focussing on delivering work that is as accessible and optimised as possible.</p> <p>More than a decade of experience building complex interfaces means that I'm happy to deliver anything from single-page apps to scaleable design systems. I can help you identify the most appropriate technology for your project and, whilst I love a good framework, you can be sure that I will never use tech for tech's sake. </p>

  - title: Code Choreography
    description: <p>I sweat the little details that bring a design to life. But, whether it's full-on WebGL or a UI interaction, animation isnâ€™t just about looking cool - Good interaction design grounds an interface with a sense of space and logic.</p> <p>I combine nuanced timing and motion with a deep understanding of browser rendering to deliver logical interactions that are both full of character and outrageously smooth.</p>

  - title: Server-side is my jam(stack)
    description: <p>Beyond front-end development, I'm a JAMstack specialist. Cloud CMS platforms, lambda functions, site-generators - Whatever your requirements, I'm happy to help you plan, build and deliver a JAMstack project that's fast, secure and reliable.</p> <p>If JAMstack isn't your thing, I'm equally at home developing for other server-side technologies. If you need help putting together an application or API with Node.js and Express, or Python and Django, then I've got your back.</p>

  - title: Let's build something better
    description: <p>I strongly believe that designers and developers have a responsibility to make sure that what we are building does no harm and I try to be as ethical as I can in taking on projects.</p> <p>If your organisation represents online gambling, payday loans, big tobacco, or mines and monetises personal data, then I am probably not the best fit for your project.</p> <p>But, if you are looking for help building something that promotes sustainability, diversity, or generally aims to make a positive impact, then letâ€™s talk.</p>
