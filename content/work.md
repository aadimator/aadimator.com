- title: About my work
  description: I work with forward-thinking people to design and build <b>intelligent,
    accessible, and innovative products/b>. From working on projects for likes of
    UNHCR, RNLI, The National Trust, and Honda, to working at startups in Tokyo, I've
    devoted more than a decade to <b>making the web a little bit brighter</b>.
- title: Considered development
  description: "<p>No two projects are the same and I take a pragmatic approach to
    each job I take on, focussing on delivering work that is as accessible and optimized
    as possible.</p> <p>Half a decade of experience building complex and innovative
    products means that I'm happy to deliver anything from web-apps to mobile apps.
    I can help you identify the most appropriate technology for your project and,
    whilst I love a good framework, you can be sure that I will never use tech for
    tech's sake. </p>"

- title: Code Choreography
  description: "<p>I sweat the little details that bring a product to life. But, whether
    it's a full-on desktop application or a single page app, it isn’t just about using
    machine learning model - Successful AI product grounds an interface with a sense
    of space and logic.</p> <p>I combine state of the art machine learning algorithms
    with a deep understanding of software design patterns to deliver intelligent and
    interactive products that are both efficient and effective.</p>"

- title: Flutter development
  description: "<p>Beyond machine learning models, I'm a mobile developer. Cross-platform
    development, database integration, user-authentication - Whatever your requirements,
    I'm happy to help you plan, build and deliver a cross-platform project that's
    fast, secure and reliable.</p> <p>If Flutter isn't your thing, I'm equally at
    home developing for other server-side technologies. If you need help putting together
    an application or API with Node.js and Express, or Python and Django, then I've
    got your back.</p>"

- title: Let's build something better
  description: |-
    <p>I strongly believe that designers and developers have a responsibility to make sure that what we are building does no harm and I try to be as ethical as I can in taking on projects.</p>

    <p>If your organization represents online gambling, payday loans, big tobacco, or mines and monetizes personal data, then I am probably not the best fit for your project.</p>

    <p>But, if you are looking for help building something that promotes sustainability, diversity, or generally aims to make a positive impact, then let’s talk.</p>
