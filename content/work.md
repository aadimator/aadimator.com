- title: About my work
  description: "<p>I work with forward-thinking people to design and build <strong>intelligent,
    accessible, and innovative products</strong>. From working on projects related
    to computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning, to
    working with the latest web and mobile technologies, I've devoted half a decade
    to make the software a little bit smarter.</p>"

- title: Considered development
  description: "<p>No two projects are the same and I take a pragmatic approach to
    each job I take on, focussing on delivering work that is as accessible and optimized
    as possible.</p><p>More than half a decade of experience building complex applications
    means that I'm happy to deliver anything from single-page apps to scalable distributed
    systems. I can help you identify the most appropriate technology for your project
    and, whilst I love a good framework, you can be sure that I will never use tech
    for tech's sake.</p>"

- title: Code Choreography
  description: "<p>I sweat the little details that bring a product to life. But, whether
    it's a full-on web application or a simple cloud function, it isn’t just about
    running code - Good coding design patterns ground an application with a sense
    of efficiency and reliability.</p><p>I combine good software development principles
    with a deep understanding of machine learning theory to deliver innovative products
    that are both intelligent and outrageously efficient.</p>"

- title: Server-side is my jam(stack)
  description: "<p>Beyond front-end development, I'm a JAMstack specialist. Cloud
    CMS platforms, lambda functions, site-generators - Whatever your requirements,
    I'm happy to help you plan, build and deliver a JAMstack project that's fast,
    secure and reliable.</p> <p>If JAMstack isn't your thing, I'm equally at home
    developing for other server-side technologies. If you need help putting together
    an application or API with Node.js and Express, or Python and Django, then I've
    got your back.</p>"

- title: Let's build something better
  description: "<p>I strongly believe that designers and developers have a responsibility
    to make sure that what we are building does no harm and I try to be as ethical
    as I can in taking on projects.</p> <p>If your organisation represents online
    gambling, payday loans, big tobacco, or mines and monetises personal data, then
    I am probably not the best fit for your project.</p> <p>But, if you are looking
    for help building something that promotes sustainability, diversity, or generally
    aims to make a positive impact, then let’s talk.</p>"
